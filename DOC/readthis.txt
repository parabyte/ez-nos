									EZNOS Source Readme
									-------------------

	EZNOS is derived from JNOS 1.11f, which in turn came from Phil Karn's KA9Q all under the
GNU/GPL open source licence.

	Directory structure:
		EZNOS -- ROOT
		  |
		  |
		  |---- Altered, most of the code i've altered from original JNOS
		  |	|
		  |	|
		  |	|---- Config, various config.h formats
		  |	|
		  |	|
		  |	|---- Makefile, various makefile files
		  |	|
		  |	|
		  |	|---- Patches, various patches applied to JNOS
		  |
		  |
		  |---- DOC, various documents included with JNOS
		  |
		  |
		  |---- ORIGINAL, some of the unalter code from JNOS

		  
	Most the code altered by myself has my initials [ KPK ] next to it, but don't quote me on 
this, some late nites this didn't happen.

	In general, EZNOS is compiled using Borlandc 3.1. Unzip the EZNOS source code ez_src.zip
into your borlandc directory. Edit the config.h file to include [define/undef] which modules 
you want to include in your version of the EZNOS executable.
	
	Make sure borlandc\bin is in your path [c:\borlandc\bin]
	Form DOS or DOS Prompt under Windows
	CD [ change directory ] to borlandc\eznos
	type the command MAKE CLEAN
	type MAKE

Thats it, it should compile without any problems.

That's all Folks,
